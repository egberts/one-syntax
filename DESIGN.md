Welcome to the One-Syntax design.

The goal is maintain a single syntax tree and then be able to export it to the following syntax/auto-completer/linter/LSP target:

1. Vimscript (vim/NeoVim)
2. TextMate (Visual Studio Code)
3. LSP (Sublime, Atom, PyCharm, Vim, Emacs, Eclipse,
4. JetBrains proprietary-extension LSP (Language Server Protocol)
